# Object Detection Project 🤖👀

This project performs **object detection** on images and returns a structured output in **JSON format**. The object detection task involves identifying objects in the given image, along with their **name**, **count**, and **dominant colors**.

## File Structure 📁

- `images/` : Folder containing images for object detection. 🖼️
- `object_detection.py` : Python script that implements object detection using the Ollama API and processes the response. 💻
- `requirements.txt` : Contains the list of dependencies needed to run the project. 📜
- `README.md` : This file providing information about the project. 📄

## Setup ⚙️

### 1. Install Dependencies 📥

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed. To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add Your Image 🖼️

Place the image you want to perform object detection on inside the `images/` folder. Make sure the file is named appropriately (e.g., `your_file.jpg`).

### 3. Configure the Ollama API 🔑

Make sure to have an **API key** for Ollama and configure it in your environment. You may add it to a `.env` file or export it as an environment variable.

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 4. Running the Object Detection ▶️

Execute the Python script `object_detection.py` to perform object detection on your image:

```bash
python object_detection.py
```

This will call the Ollama API to perform object detection and return a structured **JSON response**, including the name, count, and dominant color of each detected object.

### 5. Output 📊

The result will be printed in the terminal, containing a list of detected objects along with their attributes.

Example output:

```json
{
  "objects": [
    {
      "name": "cat",
      "color": ["brown", "black"],
      "count": 2
    },
    {
      "name": "car",
      "color": ["red"],
      "count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dependencies 📚
